this is a mod that adds an npc called the "Retired Weaponsmith".
he is not a painter. no matter what he tells you, he is not a painter.
this guy is a bastard. he takes every weapon in the world and sells it back to you.

you have to deal with it and just use his weapons. good luck getting any other weapons outside of the ones he sells you.

btw, his prices increase overtime, and the weapons you get will likely be awful

there are temporary ways to reduce the amount you pay, but im not gonna tell you - read the code lol ;)

good luck :)
