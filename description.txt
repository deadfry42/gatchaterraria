[c/E11919:WARNING] - this mod is potentially [c/FF1919:destructive] on other worlds.
[c/FFF014:if you plan on playing this mod, please make a new world & player.]
(this is because when rolling a new item, all of your current weapons get deleted)

----------

this mod adds a new npc called the "Retired Weaponsmith"
he is VERY annoying

he stole all of the weapons in the world, making every weapon unobtainable.
instead, you need to get your weapons from him.

each time you spin a new item from him, you get a random weapon, based on your progression ingame
but each time the price goes up, and up, until you have to pay 5 platinum for a copper shortsword.

there are ways to mitigate his prices, or get a better deal, or get the weapons you want,
but it makes the game a LOT harder.

good luck :)
