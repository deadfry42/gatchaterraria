This is a text document detailing exactly how randomguy (Retired Weaponsmith) works.

last updated: 07/09/2024 DD/MM/YYYY

DIALOGUE:
the npc will tell you important information each time you talk to him. there are (11 * 6) + (2 * 4) + (8 * 1) = 82 different things he can say when simply interacting.
There are seperate conditions that have to be accounted for, and that is why there are so many.
This is the priority order, and explanation of what each condition is:
1 - coupon choosing -> when you use a coupon, it prompts you to choose between 2 weapons. If you exit and interact with him again later, this one would work first before all of the others
2 - discount card && generous -> when you have a discount card equipped and he is generous
3 - discount card -> when you have a discount card equipped
4 - first roll -> when you are going to get your first weapon
5 - hm discount && coupon -> when you are getting your free weapon from the demon heart and you have a coupon
6 - hm discount -> when you are getting your free weapon from the demon heart
7 - lantern night && coupon && generous -> when you are getting 10% off from lantern night, 50% off because he's generous and you have a coupon
8 - lantern night && coupon -> when you are getting 10% off from a lantern night, and you have a coupon
9 - lantern night && generous -> when you are getting 10% off from a lantern night, and he's generous
10 - lantern night -> when you are getting 10% off from a lantern night
11 - coupon && generous -> when he's generous and you have a coupon
12 - coupon -> when you have a coupon
13 - generous -> when he's generous
14 - normal chat -> normal chat

MECHANICS:
here are some conditions in which something will be different
- coupon:
the coupon refers to the "Buy 1 get 1 free coupon" you can get from boss bags in expert & master mode
it allows you to pay for one item, and then get to choose between two.
- hm discount:
when you use a demon heart in expert & master mode, you get a free weapon.
it allows you to get a free hard mode weapon at the start, to help you
- lantern night:
once you defeat a boss, the next night will be a lantern night
the retired weaponsmith will give you a 10% discount when the lanterns are up
- generous:
every time you talk to the retired weaponsmith, there is a 1/8192 chance that he will be generous
this means you will have 50% off, but if you exit the dialogue it will be rerolled
unless you are incredibly lucky, it means that you will not have that 50% off anymore.
- discount card:
when you have a discount card equipped, he will refuse to sell you weapons.
this is because there already exists a coupon.
- arguing:
this is when you spam the price button, in hopes of lowering the price.
he will lower the price, but this can only happen 3 times throughout your playthrough
- class tickets:
these are tickets bought from the merchant which narrows your weapon options to only that class
this is immensly useful for making sure you don't have to get new armour each time you get a new weapon
- brainwash:
this is a single use item which will wipe all of your data.
it is a one time use throughout your playthrough.\

VANILLA CHANGES:
in order to make this mod work, certain things about the game to make sure you don't get another weapon.
these consist of a few files, found in Content/GameplayChanges
- IlEditing.cs
This file uses MonoMod to edit certain functions in the terraria code.
it is used to make sure you cannot drop or lose your item. (wip)
- ModifyChestGeneration.cs
This file replaces each weapon in every generated chest with 1-10 gold.
- ModifyGlobalItems.cs
This file makes sure that you cannot get weapons from boss bags
and handles using the demon heart to get a free weapon
- NewItemDrops.cs
This file handles the ability to get the class tickets and the brainwash item
the name is kind of misleading
- RemoveNPCWeapons.cs
This file handles removing all of the dropped weapons from NPCs
which handles classic bosses and normal enemies, like demons & demon scythes
- RemoveTileWeapons.cs
This file handles removing all of the dropped weapons from all tiles in the game
eg. removing weapons from shadow orb / crimson heart.
- RemoveWeaponRecipes.cs
This files handles removing all of the weapon recipes.

thank you for reading and I hope this helps
